# codeBase64
A  JavaScript plug-in can be encoded and decoded with Base64.<br>

###Illustration
This plug-in can used for characters which UNICODE is between 0000 0000 and 0000 FFFF.<br>
Include Number, English, Chinese, Korean and so on.<br>
And you can set the Secret Key by your own situation.

###Example
I write a simple demo for example.<br>
If you do not fill Secret Key, the default is null. Result is encode or decode your input directly.
